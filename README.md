# Odin Flight Booker

A one-way flight booker using nested forms and test-first development for The Odin Project's [Project: Advanced Forms](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-on-rails/building-advanced-forms).

## Tests

Run the test suite with `rake` or `rspec spec/`.

## Setup

After running `bundle install` and `rake db:migrate`, you should run `rake db:seed`. *Note that Postgres db was used*.

#### Flight and Airport Data

The faux data used for booking flights is generated by running `rake db:seed`.
By default, data is created for an average of about 7 flights a day for 9 days in the future between 5 US airports.
If you wish, you can customize how much data is seeded in the database. From the `#create_data` method of `db/seeds.rb`, you can change the `avg_daily_flights`, `number_of_days`, and `airports_limit` variables. Around `avg_daily_flights` flights will be created for `number_of_days` days in the future between every pair of `airports_limit` airports. *Be aware that increasing the `airports_limit` will cause a quadratic increase in the size of data seeded*. 

## Usage

The simple flow of the flight booking app is as follows:

1. Choose desired airports, number of passengers, date; then Search
2. Choose Flight from among the available flight(s)
3. Enter information about each passenger; then Book Flight

Only flights on days in the future may be booked. _(If no **Flight dates** are available from the search page, you will have to run 'rake db:seed' to generate data for some future flights.)_ 

#### Email

Be aware that the app will send a thank you email to all passengers after a booking is made.
